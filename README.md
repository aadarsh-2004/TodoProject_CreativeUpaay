## Deliverables:

1. **Design Implementation**:  
   The project should match the design provided in the Figma reference. All UI components must be styled according to the Figma layout.

2. **Task Management**:
   - **Add Task Feature**: Implement functionality to add tasks to each section (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done).
   - **Dynamic Task Details**: Tasks should have dynamic names and descriptions, while other details can be hardcoded for simplicity.
   
3. **Drag and Drop**:
   - Users should be able to move tasks between different sections using drag and drop functionality.

4. **Filtering**:
   - Implement a filtering feature to filter tasks based on status, priority, or any other task attributes.

5. **State Management**:
   - Use **Redux** for state management (beginner level), handling tasks and UI state.

6. **Authentication**:
   - Implement **Basic Authentication** using **Firebase**, including support for **Google Authentication**.

7. **Due Date Reminder**:
   - Add functionality to set due dates for tasks.
   - Implement a reminder feature, notifying the user when a task is close to or past its due date using a visible alert or banner notification.
